* Emacs Journey Part 2: Witchmacs!!
** Why Witchmacs over Doom Emacs?
Witchmacs is a much more minimal initial config and I believe that it is easier to add my own configuration to a simpler initial config.

In short, Doom Emacs is very featureful, but when it comes to adding to it, I'm not sure where to start.

** The Installation Process
Literally as simple as running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
** My personal configurations
I added several things to the .emacs.d/config.org file which is the main configuration file for witchmacs and it feels quite nice!
